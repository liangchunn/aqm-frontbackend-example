## Installing
Go to `backend/` and `frontend/` and `npm install` on each folder.

## Running
Open a new Terminal window in `backend/` and run
```sh
npm start
```

Next, do the same in a *new* Terminal window in `frontend/`
```sh
npm start
```

You should now see a new window being spawned.
The front-end interfaces with the backend!
Check out `fontend/src/App.js` to see how it interfaces with the backend
